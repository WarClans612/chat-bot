This tests/ folder contains test to try that most parts of the component works as wanted.

Each module contains simple unittest check for each of the component:
    sensor_fetch
    bot
    fb_api
    
Test for bot is not done for all of the function separately due to many dependency between functions.

To run individual check towards each component, run the following command:
    python3 tests/<test-module>
        <test-module> : change into the respective python file being used
