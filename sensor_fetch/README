The sensor_fetch/ folder contain module to fetch data from the sensor.
Most data used is collected from http://opendata2.epa.gov.tw.
For more detailed understanding of how the data is received, it can be checked from the URL itself.

util.py contains most of the important module to process the command needed for the other module.

Each weather correspond module (pm25.py, rainfall.py, station.py, uvi.py, weather.py)
uses module in util to simplify the process of fetching, parsing, and processing into or out of DB.

sky.py and sensor_highest_value,py has more special function to gather the data from database.
This two modules does not directly correspond to a specific weather type but is still used for the bot.
